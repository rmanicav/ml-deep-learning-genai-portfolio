# Machine Learning, Deep Learning & GenAI Project Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains a curated set of hands-on projects covering
classical machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI. The projects
were developed to strengthen practical understanding of model design,
training, evaluation, and real-world application.

The focus is on implementation quality, model comparison, and applied use
cases rather than isolated theory.

## Project Categories

### 1. Classical Machine Learning
- Classification and regression models
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Algorithms: Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest,
  Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-means clustering

### 2. Deep Learning
- Neural network fundamentals
- CNN-based models for pattern recognition
- LSTM models for sequential and time-series data
- Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation

### 3. Generative AI & Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Prompt engineering and structured prompting techniques
- LLM-based task automation and reasoning workflows
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) concepts and implementations
- Agent-based AI workflows using modern frameworks
- Integration of LLMs with external tools and data sources

### 4. Automation & AI Workflows
- Low-code and no-code automation using n8n
- Orchestration of AI workflows combining ML models, LLMs, and APIs
- End-to-end pipelines for data ingestion, processing, and AI-driven tasks

## Tools & Technologies
- Programming: Python
- ML/DL: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- GenAI & LLMs: HuggingFace, LangChain, CrewAI, OpenAI-compatible LLMs
- RAG: Vector embeddings, similarity search, document retrieval pipelines
- Automation: n8n
- Data: Pandas, NumPy
- Experimentation: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab

## Context
These projects were developed as part of an intensive, hands-on learning
program focused on applied machine learning, deep learning, and generative
AI. They complement my PhD research in computer engineering (applied machine
learning) and my professional experience in large-scale software systems.
